# Robotic_systems_task_kuka_sim_pro

This was the semester task for the Robotics Systems subject in the Hochschule Emden/Leer.

Here you can find how it is looks like.

Created good 3-dimensional FIFO sorting algorithm in the restricted area (Workspace of the robot covers just a small part of the table) for the "Sorting robot".

Welding robot very accuratly covers top surface of the part.
